# Contributing

This repository follows the guidelines of [Trunk based development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/). We use the 'scalable' approach of branching off and merging into master using pull requests. We use Issues exclusively for feature requests and bug fixes; support and vague ideas should be posted in the dedicated GitHub discussions tab.
